Project Title: Design and Simulation of a BJT-Based Pulse Generator using eSim

Objective: To design and simulate a monostable multivibrator circuit using two Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) within the eSim environment. The circuit aims to generate a single output pulse of a fixed duration in response to a short input trigger pulse. The duration of the output pulse should be primarily determined by the time constant of an RC network, matching the behavior described in the reference literature [1].

Software Used:

eSim Version 2.5

KiCad (Integrated Schematic Editor)

Ngspice (Simulation Engine)

Circuit Description: The circuit is based on a standard two-stage BJT monostable multivibrator configuration. It consists of two NPN BJT stages (Q1, Q2 - using BC547B models). The input trigger is applied to the base of Q1. An RC network (R3=10kΩ, C1=100nF) couples the collector of Q1 to the base of Q2. Resistors R1(10kΩ), R2(1kΩ), and R4(1kΩ) provide biasing. The power supply (Vcc) is 5V. The output is taken from the collector of Q2.

Simulation and Results: Transient analysis was performed using Ngspice.

Input: A short positive pulse (0V to 5V, 10µs width, starting at 1ms) applied to vin.

Output: Voltage measured at vout. The simulation successfully demonstrated the generation of an output pulse (approx. 0.7ms duration) in response to the short input trigger, confirming the expected monostable operation controlled by the R3*C1 time constant.

Important Note on Simulation Method: During this project, persistent errors were encountered with the standard eSim "KiCad to Ngspice" conversion process, preventing successful simulation directly through the eSim interface (specifically, Ngspice reported UTF-8 syntax errors or generated incorrect .cir files). The Ngspice engine itself was confirmed to be working correctly. To obtain the simulation results, the .cir file generated by eSim had to be manually corrected (fixing source values, replacing GND with 0, embedding the .model definition, and removing invalid comments). The final, successful simulation was performed by running Ngspice directly from the terminal using this manually corrected .cir file. The schematic and .net files generated by KiCad/eSim are provided, along with the corrected .cir file and the .raw simulation output.
